# Digital-Citizen-Card
This project implements a system for selectively disclosing identity attributes in a digital environment while proving their ownership and ensuring their correctness. Inspired by traditional Citizen Cards (CC), the system allows users to generate a Digital Citizen Card (DCC), selectively disclose attributes, and validate them securely.
